# Fonts

This package contains the fonts for Autodesk Weave.

## Getting started

### Install the package

```bash
yarn add @weave-design/fonts
```

## Basic usage

The design system specifies three font weights, 400, 600, and 700. For ease of use we provide `ArtifactElement.css` which imports those three weights.

```js
/* ArtifaktElement font w/ weights used in the design system (400, 600, and 700)  */
import "@weave-design/fonts/build/ArtifaktElement.css";
```
