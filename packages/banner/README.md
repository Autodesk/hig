# Banner

Banners are notifications alerting an event that requires a user action. They are similar toasts except banners are not sparked by the userâ€™s action, therefore they require a different design.  Banners are primarily used for global messages about the system that can be simply informational (blue) or color coded to signal success (green), warning (yellow) and error (red).
