# Banner

Banners are notifications alerting an event that requires a user action. They are similar toasts except banners are not sparked by the userâ€™s action, therefore they require a different design.  Banners are primarily used for global messages about the system that can be simply informational (blue) or color coded to signal success (green), warning (yellow) and error (red).

## Getting started

```
yarn add @weave-design/banner @weave-design/theme-context @weave-design/theme-data
```

## Import the component

```
import Banner from '@weave-design/banner';
```

## Basic usage

```jsx
<Banner type="primary">
  Make sure you know these changes will effect your project status
</Banner>
```

## With actions

```jsx
<Banner
  type="primary"
  actions={({ isWrappingActions }) => (
    <Banner.Interactions isWrappingActions={isWrappingActions}>
      <Banner.Action>
        <Button
          type="secondary"
          size="small"
          width={isWrappingActions ? "grow" : "shrink"}
          title={text(
            "Resolve text",
            t(languages, chosenLanguage, "BANNER_RESOLVE_BUTTON_TEXT")
          )}
        />
      </Banner.Action>
      <Banner.Action>
        <Button
          type="secondary"
          size="small"
          width={isWrappingActions ? "grow" : "shrink"}
          title={text(
            "Reject text",
            t(languages, chosenLanguage, "BANNER_REJECT_BUTTON_TEXT")
          )}
        />
      </Banner.Action>
    </Banner.Interactions>
  )}
>
  Make sure you know these changes will effect your project status
</Banner>
```
## Custom CSS

Use the `className` prop to pass in a css class name to the outermost container of the component. The class name will also pass down to most of the other styled elements within the component.
